[31m-**What is _GitHub Actions_?**: GitHub Actions is a flexible way to automate nearly every aspect of your team's software workflow. You can automate testing, continuously deploy, review code, manage issues and pull requests, and much more. The best part, these workflows are stored as code in your repository and easily shared and reused across teams. To learn more, check out these resources:[m
[32m+[m[32mHere's what the entries in the `welcome.yml` file, on the `welcome-workflow` branch, mean:[m
 [m
[31m-- The GitHub Actions feature page, see [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).[m
[31m-- The "GitHub Actions" user documentation, see [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions).[m
[32m+[m[32m- `name: Post welcome comment` gives your workflow a name. This name will appear in the Actions tab of your repository.[m
[32m+[m[32m- `on: pull_request: types: [opened]` indicates that your workflow will execute whenever someone opens a pull request in your repository.[m
[32m+[m[32m- `permissions` assigns the workflow permissions to operate on the repository[m
[32m+[m[32m- `pull-requests: write` gives the workflow permission to write to pull requests. This is needed to create the welcome comment.[m
 [m
[31m-**What is a _workflow_?**: A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows are defined in special files in the `.github/workflows` directory and they execute based on your chosen event. For this exercise, we'll use a `pull_request` event.[m
[32m+[m[32mNext, we need to specify jobs to run.[m
 [m
[31m-- To read more about workflows, jobs, and events, see "[Understanding GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions)".[m
[31m-- If you want to learn more about the `pull_request` event before using it, see "[pull_request](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request)".[m
[32m+[m[32m**What is a _job_?**: A job is a set of steps in a workflow that execute on the same runner (a runner is a server that runs your workflows when triggered). Workflows have jobs, and jobs have steps. Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other. You'll add steps to your workflow later in the course. To read more about jobs, see "[Jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#jobs)".[m
 [m
[31m-To get you started, we ran an Actions workflow in your new repository that, among other things, created a branch for you to work in, called `welcome-workflow`.[m
[32m+[m[32mIn the following activity, you'll add a "build" job to your workflow. You'll specify `ubuntu-latest` as the fastest, and cheapest, job runner available. If you want to read more about why we'll use that runner, see the code explanation for the line `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` in the "[Understanding the workflow file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions#understanding-the-workflow-file)" article.[m
